description: Design and scaffold Laravel backend modules using Domain-Driven Design with action-based architecture and event-driven communication. Use when creating or refactoring Laravel modules, RESTful APIs, or microservice slices with explicit Domain/Application/Infrastructure separation. Triggers on requests for DDD, bounded contexts, Domain Actions, UseCases, Domain Events, cross-domain communication, or any feature that needs clear layer separation.

# Domain Driven Design

## Workflow

1. Understand the requirement. Extract the business behavior, trigger, state transition, and side effects.
2. Identify the bounded context or module.
3. Define the minimum slice: Entity, Action, DTO, Model, Provider, Repository contract, Domain Event, UseCase, EventHandler or Controller.
4. Decide communication boundaries: same domain → Action; cross-domain → Domain Event; cross-service → queue or Kafka.
5. Decide sync vs async. Default sync for request-critical changes, async for retries and fan-out.
6. Generate code from `templates/`. Read only the files needed and replace every placeholder with domain-specific, compile-safe code.
7. Write tests:
   - **Unit test** — Domain layer only: Actions, Entities, Domain Services. Mock Repository contracts. No framework, no DB.
   - **Integration test** — Application layer only: UseCases with a real repository hitting a test DB. No mocks for persistence.
8. Run tests: `php artisan test` — fix all failures before considering the task done.

## Layer Rules

- Business logic in `*Action` only.
- `*UseCase` is orchestration-only — calls one Action, nothing else.
- Domain is framework-independent — no Eloquent, no Facades.
- Actions call only same-domain components: Entities, Repository contracts, Domain Services, Events.
- Every DTO must extend `BaseDTO` (`Modules\Shared\DTOs\BaseDTO`). Every constructor parameter must have a `#[Rules([...])]` PHP attribute. `BaseDTO::rules()` derives the validation array from those attributes via reflection — subclasses must not override it. `fromRequest()` calls `static::validate($request)` (provided by `BaseDTO`) before constructing. Before scaffolding, check if `Modules/Shared/DTOs/BaseDTO.php` already exists. If absent, scaffold `BaseDTO` and the `Rules` attribute from `BaseDTO.template` and `RulesAttribute.template`.
- Eloquent Models in Infrastructure for ORM mapping only — never as Domain Entities.
- Providers in Infrastructure for bindings and wiring only — no business logic.
- Repository interfaces in Domain; implementations in Infrastructure.
- Events are immutable, named in past tense, and handlers are idempotent.
- Cross-domain: emit an Event, never inject another domain's Action or Repository.
- Controllers and Listeners are thin: validate, translate, delegate.

## Default Layout

`Modules/` lives at the **project root**. Never place domain code inside `app/`.

## Response Shape

Design-only or ambiguous tasks: **Analysis → Design → Code → Events → Notes**.

Implementation tasks: write code first; use the structure above only if it adds clarity.
