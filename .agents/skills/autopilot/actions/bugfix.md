# Bugfix Action

1. Capture expected behavior, actual behavior, and reproduction trigger.
2. Inspect only related files and identify the first wrong behavior before editing.
3. Write a regression test that reproduces the bug when practical (should fail before fix).
4. Apply the smallest root-cause fix; avoid unrelated refactors.
5. Run the regression test and related tests when a test runner is configured; confirm the fix passes.
6. Run `npm run build`; broaden test scope when reasonable.
7. Summarize root cause, fix, files, tests, risk, and next step.
